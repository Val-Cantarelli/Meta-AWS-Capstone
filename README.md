# Meta AWS Capstone Project

This repository showcases my work in deploying a Django-based capstone project to AWS.  
The [APIRest](https://github.com/Val-Cantarelli/MetaDeveloperProfessionalCertificate) was developed as part of the **Meta Professional Certificate**, and this repository focuses on the DevOps and cloud migration aspects.

## Overview


The project offers a fully cloud-based solution for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in the food service sector, with an estimated operational cost of **USD 45-50/month** in production. During development and migration with AWS Free Tier benefits, costs remain around **USD 80** total. The system is designed to be generic enough for different types of restaurants while being flexible enough to meet the needs of the three main business actors: managers, employees, and end customers (as well as the admin who holds all the privileges).

The goal is to enable restaurants to implement, at low cost and with high availability, a complete online ordering and reservation system — from the digital menu and table bookings to delivery — by leveraging AWS managed services to reduce operational effort and increase scalability.

This repository focuses on:

1. Migrating the database to Amazon RDS;
2. Deploying the back end to AWS Lambda;
3. Deploying the front end to AWS Elastic Beanstalk;
4. Hosting static and media files in Amazon S3;
5. Setting up CI/CD (evaluating GitHub Actions vs AWS native tools);
6. Documenting the AWS infrastructure and operational setup.

## Architecture

![alt text](/img/diagramMigrationAWS.png)

- **Frontend:** Django app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk (basic customer interface with limited functionality);
- **API:** AWS Lambda behind Amazon API Gateway HTTP API (v2) - fully featured REST API;
- **Database:** Amazon RDS, accessed by Lambda via Amazon RDS Proxy;
- **Assets:** Amazon S3 for static/media.


## Versions

### Version 1 (Current)

## Technical Details

- Frontend on Elastic Beanstalk (ASGI – Gunicorn + Uvicorn): provides basic customer interface with Django templates (menu browsing, user authentication, table booking). Ordering system, cart management, order tracking, and role-based access are API-only;
- Backend on Lambda (Mangum ASGI): complete REST API with JWT authentication, role-based permissions (manager/delivery-crew/customer), shopping cart, order management, menu administration, and comprehensive filtering/pagination;
- Stateless across environments: frontend makes HTTP calls to the API Gateway, enabling independent scaling and clear separation of concerns. 

Purpose: validate frontend integration and API functionality in the cloud with reliable database connectivity, keeping operational costs around **USD 45-50/month** while leaving room for future real-time features without major re-architecture.

## Current Implementation Status

**Backend (REST API)**: Complete
- Full CRUD operations for menu items, categories, cart, orders
- JWT authentication with Djoser integration
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Delivery Crew, Customer)
- Comprehensive filtering, pagination, and search
- Rate limiting and security features
- OpenAPI 3.0 documentation

**Frontend (Customer Interface)**: ⚠️ **Limited Implementation**
- Menu browsing and visualization
- User authentication (login/signup)
- Table booking functionality (when logged in)
- Missing: ordering system, cart management, order tracking, user profiles, role-based interfaces
- All restaurant management and ordering features are API-only
- Suitable for demonstration but not production-ready for full restaurant operations

### Version 2 (Planned)
- Backend migrated from Lambda to ECS Fargate

Purpose: Although the backend already runs ASGI on Lambda via Mangum, executions are still ephemeral and there is no native support for WebSockets or long‑lived connections. If the application evolves to require real‑time features or continuous workloads and the budget increases, the plan is to migrate to ECS Fargate to run a native ASGI server with persistent workers, improving latency predictability and networking control.
